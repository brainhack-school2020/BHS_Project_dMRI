## Summary 

I am a first-year PhD student in Biomedical Engineering at Polytechnique Montreal. I am new in this field of MRI and this is my first time to begin an MRI project. The overall goal of this project in BHS is to be familiar with pipeline of diffusion tensor imaging and Python. Thus I can start new project of my study based on this project.

## Project definition 

### Background

Hypoglycemia is a common problem in preterm newborns. While being a relatively long-known disease, with a first recognized case in 1911, there is still no clear and consistent definition of hypoglycemia and what conditions can cause brain damage because of rational evidence lack [ ]. Existing research showed that hypoglycemia can lead to serious encephalopathy and brain functional damage, such as visual impairment, epilepsy and cognitive deficits. Additionally, hypoglycemia can cause both transient and permanent structural abnormalities on infant brains [ ]. However, few studies have reported a quantification of the impact of hypoglycemia on neonatal brain development. This is possibly limited by the relatively low sensitivity of brain microstructure imaging techniques. Reports indicated that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has a higher in vivo sensitivity to lesions in soft tissues, compared to other imaging modalities, and has the potential to identify and quantify hypoglycemic brain damage.

A new model overcoming these challenges needs to be developed. The model is supposed to precisely estimate the level of increased cellularity, edema and axon / myelin injury caused by hypoglycemia.

### Tools 

The "D-MRI Model for Impacts Qualificaiton of Hypoglycemia on Brain" project will rely on the following technologies: 
 * Python to be the main language used to complete this project.
 * [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), to structure the text.
 * SourceTree to manage the repository.
 * Visual Studio Code to be code editor.



### Data 

Since this proposed multi tensor diffusion method has no additional scanning machine requirements than clinical, online public dataset will be used to test this model.  

### Deliverables

At the end of this project, we will have:
 - Open-source code based on Python.
 - A diffusion MRI model dedicated to accurate mapping of the microsturture of preterm baby brains. 

## Results 

### Progress overview

The project was swiftly initiated by P Bellec, based on the existing template created in 2019 by Tristan Glatard and improved by different students. It was really not that hard. Community feedback is expected to lead to rapid further improvements of this first version. 

### Tools I learned during this project

 * **Meta-project** P Bellec learned how to do a meta project for the first time, which is developping a framework while using it at the same time. It felt really weird, but somehow quite fun as well. 
 * **Github workflow-** The successful use of this template approach will demonstrate that it is possible to incorporate dozens of students presentation on a website collaboratively over a few weeks. 
 * **Project content** Through the project reports generated using the template, it is possible to learn about what exactly the brainhack school students are working on. 
 
### Results 

#### Deliverable 1: report template

You are currently reading the report template! I will let you judge whether it is useful or not. If you think there is something that could be improved, please do not hesitate to open an issue [here](https://github.com/brainhack-school2020/project_template/issues) and let us know. 

#### Deliverable 2: project gallery

There is not yet a project gallery, as BHS 2020 is the first edition that will incorporate it on the website. You can still check out the [2019 BHS github organization](https://github.com/mtl-brainhack-school-2019)

##### ECG pupilometry pipeline by Marce Kauffmann 

The repository of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/mtl-brainhack-school-2019/ecg_pupillometry_pipeline_kaufmann). The objective was to create a processing pipeline for ECG and pupillometry data. The motivation behind this task is that Marcel's lab (MIST Lab @ Polytechnique Montreal) was conducting a Human-Robot-Interaction user study. The repo features:
 * a [video introduction](http://www.youtube.com/watch/8ZVCNeX42_A) to the project.
 * a presentation [made in a jupyter notebook](https://github.com/mtl-brainhack-school-2019/ecg_pupillometry_pipeline_kaufmann/blob/master/BrainHackPresentation.ipynb) on the results of the project.
 * Notebooks for all analyses.
 * Detailed requirements files, making it easy for others to replicate the environment of the notebook.
 * An overview of the results in the markdown document.

## Conclusion and acknowledgement

The BHS team hope you will find this template helpful in documenting your project. Developping this template was a group effort, and benefitted from the feedback and ideas of all BHS students over the years.
